      <p> Currently interning here for the spring semester working on the build engineering team. Here I work on creating or improving tools to maximize the efficiency of our CI pipeline. Such things include tools to log constant merge conflicts, wrapper around bazel build system, and figuring out how to run our CI pipeline locally.</p>

      <p class="text-right"> I interned here for a total of 3 summers, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Each one in a different location and team. <br /> I did the engineering practicum internship my first summer working in the Ads product area in the NYC office. My second internship here was on the Google Local Services team in Mountain View CA. During these two internships I worked on a similar project involving building a pipeline that allows us to analyze contents of different advertiser assets. This was done by integrating with cloud vision and natural language apis.<br />My third summer I was a software engineering intern on the Payments team working remotely. Here I worked on improving and creating new microservices to be used on launching different carriers. In doing so I was able to make this tedious process more efficient and flexible for those using the tool. </p>

      <p> This was my first and longest internship. I interned here from August 2017 to June 2018. Here the goal was to help in training and providing help to present and future NYC public school computer science teachers. For instance, here I presented teachers with various tools they could use in their curriculum. However, I also helped with other activities, such as writings scripts that fetch and clean data, an inventory checkout system using Node and Google Sheets, and other smaller tasks.</p>
